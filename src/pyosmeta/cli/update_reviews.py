"""
Script that parses metadata from na issue and adds it to a yml file for the
website. It also grabs some of the package metadata such as stars,
last commit, etc.

Output: packages.yml file containing a list of
 1. all packages with accepted reviews
 2. information related to the review including reviewers, editors
 3. basic package stats including stars, etc.

To run at the CLI: parse_issue_metadata
"""

# TODO: if we export files we might want packages.yml and then under_review.yml
# thus we'd want to add a second input parameters which was file_name
# TODO: feature - Would be cool to create an "under review now" list as well -
# ideally this could be passed as a CLI argument with the label we want to
# search for
# TODO: 1. add gh metadata to the review object
# prior to parsing
# 2. work on update-all!!
# 3. i think package_description might not be parsing right?
